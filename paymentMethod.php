  <h2>Payment Methods</h2>
  <p class="description">
    At VK Store, we offer two convenient payment options for our customers. Please review the details below before completing your purchase.<br>

    <br>1. Cash on Delivery (COD)<br>

    Customers can choose to pay in cash upon receiving their order.<br>
    This method is available for eligible locations only. Please check with our support team if COD is available in your area.<br>
    Customers must have the exact amount ready as delivery personnel may not carry change.<br>
    If the customer refuses to accept the order upon delivery, VK Store reserves the right to deny future COD orders.<br>

    <br>2. ABA Bank (Payway Checkout Ecommerce)<br>

    Customers can securely pay online using ABA Bankâ€™s Payway Checkout system.<br>
    This method allows payments via ABA Bank accounts and supported debit/credit cards.<br>
    Transactions are processed through a secure payment gateway to ensure customer data protection.<br>
    Once payment is confirmed, the order will be processed and shipped accordingly.<br>

    <br>By purchasing from VK Store, you agree to our Payment Terms and Conditions.
